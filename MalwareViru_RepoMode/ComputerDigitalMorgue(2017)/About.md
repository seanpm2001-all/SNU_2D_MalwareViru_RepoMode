# About

This is an old repository that was developed from July 3rd 2017 to July 20th 2017. It is the original malware center, a year before SNU even started (version 3.0.x didn't happen until nearly 1 and a half years after the last version of this repo was created) It was added here for legacy reasons.

This repository is no longer updated and does not accept updates.

This is a very old HTML project, and one of my first HTML repositories. As such, it is very basic, as I was very inexperienced with HTML back then when I made this. I didn't even know how to get images into a page yet. The file is mostly headings, be warned.
